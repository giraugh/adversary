## Building
Adversary is written in python3 using the `ics` and `arrow` pip modules.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/giraugh/adversary
cd adversary
```

Then setup a virtualenv to install the dependencies seperately to your global installation.
```bash
python -m venv .venv
```
You should see your promot update with the venv name `.venv`.

Now install the pip modules from the freeze file `requirements.txt`.
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Now you can run the python file with
```bash
python main.py
```
